We just released [NSFW Filter v2.3.0](https://github.com/nsfw-filter/nsfw-filter/releases/tag/v2.3.0). Here's what's new.

## Whitelist Websites

We heard your feedback! Now you can add a list of websites to a whitelist to prevent NSFW Filter from running on these sites.

We will add blacklist and advanced whitelist features in the future.

## New Look

NSFW Filter got a complete makeover with new logos and color schemes. The UI of the popup was also improved to remove bugs and look cleaner.

## Bug Fixes

v2.3.0 also fixes bugs from the previous versions which improves the performance of the extension.

## What's Next?

We have some new features in line that are waiting to be released. One of the most important ones is the toggle switch which lets you turn off the extension on specific websites.

If you have an idea for a feature, open an issue at [github.com/nsfw-filter/nsfw-filter/issues](https://github.com/nsfw-filter/nsfw-filter/issues) or send an email to [mailnsfwfilter@gmail.com](mailto:mailnsfwfilter@gmail.com).
